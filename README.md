# Daily Calorie Counter
## Zindua School â€“ JavaScript Week 3 Project
You are tasked with building a Calorie Counter using JavaScript. The application should allow users to add, manage, and remove food items while keeping track of daily calorie consumption.

## Calorie Tracking Features
- Add new food items with their calorie count.
- Display all food items added for the day.
- Remove food items from the list.
- Calculate and display the total number of calories consumed.
- Reset calorie count to start fresh for a new day.
- Persist food data using localStorage so the data remains after page refresh.

## Technical Requirements
- **HTML5** for page structure.
- **CSS3** (Tailwind CSS) for styling.
- **JavaScript** (ES6+ features) for core logic.
- **DOM Manipulation** to update the interface dynamically.
- **Event Handling** to capture user actions.
- `localStorage` for persistent data storage.
- **Fetch API** to simulate getting food calorie data.
- **Git** for version control with meaningful commits.
- Deployment using GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.

## Project Organisation
### Project Set-Up
- Create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
- Link JavaScript and CSS to HTML.
### User Interface
- A form for adding food items with calorie input.
- A list to display added food items.
- A section showing the total calorie count.
- A reset button to clear the list.
### Functionality and Implementation
- Use JavaScript functions to add, remove, and update calorie records.
- Utilize event listeners for handling clicks and form submissions.
- Use DOM methods to manipulate elements dynamically.
- Implement cookies to store food items persistently.
- Use the Fetch API to get calorie data (simulated with a placeholder API).
### Documentation and Best Practices
- Use comments and docstrings to explain functions.
- Maintain a clean code structure for readability.
- Include a `README.md` file with setup instructions and project details.
